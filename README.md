# **User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project**

# Project Title: Eco Friendly Fellow - a webpage for environmental tips and information

# *[Eco Friendly Fellow- a webpage for environmental hacks ](https://neiloernesto89.github.io/project1-ux/)*

# *Design brief:*
 One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
 
 
>The goal of this project is to create a UX-centric website. We were expected to use the skills we have learned to date, particularly HTML and CSS, to achieve this goal.


## **My project is a website intended for people with interest in environment and how they can learn more about it **

**My project is essentially a website focued on people who want to learn more about how to reduce their carbon footprint and be more enviromentally aware.**

I want to use the site as a platform for people to easily navigate and digest the information I'm presenting. There are plenty of links to reports and journalistic pieces I found to be healpful and interesting as well as not too dense. 

I provide some statistics, such as on the footers, using a Bootstrap icon as a link to a seperate web page, that I feel would capture the imagination and then offer up some of my own hacks/tips. Also, for example, on the Tips sections, I give a simple statement, offering some advice as well as providing a link with more detailed information.

There are sections where I offer some information about myself and how someone could contact me.
I aim to use the site in the future for my own personal career. 

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.


## UX

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

With regards to UX, my overarching goal was to provide very simple website, that the User can navigate easily whilst digesting the information that has been presented, in a smooth and effcient manner. I wanted to keep the design very simple, easy to navigate, use some eye catching color (green is prominent) and also use some photos that I took myself, which I found to be visually very stimulating, but without taking too much off the content. This balance was suprisingly tricky to achieve at times but I feel I found it. 

My ideal user would be someone who is potentially interested in learning more about the environment and would retain some of the facts and tips that I have laid out. I tried to keep the site uniform across platforms as to retain to it's simplicity.

I used Balsamiq to create simple wireframes to help me visual my outline for the site. 
I used a mobile-first approach, again focusing on simple and effcient design where the user would naturally navigate through the different pages

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

Underneath is my intial wireframe that I designed on my own: 


![Wireframe page 1](https://github.com/NeiloErnesto89/project1-ux/blob/master/images/wireframe1.jpg "Wireframe Page 1")



I wanted the user story to stay flexible, the idea is that someone is perusing the material, obviously starting on the landing page but then using the navigation bar to go through the pages. The Tips, Scores and Media sections would be for people searching general information about the environment, with some facts and country rankings as well as photos, a video and audio file. The option is also there for users who would be interested, in reaching out to me for information, questions or a potential project. I find that those enviromentally inclined are very much willing to get involved but often the most difficult part is starting or finding someone to reach out to. So I aimed to provide a personal touch and platform for a connection via the About and Contact section. 

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.


I used a navbar to give the user a go-to directly to orientate themself. 

The nav bar is consistent throughout the site. 

The main landing is a simple jumbotron just offering up the essential information. 

The tips section I used cards that adapt as you move through the different platforms, with a button on the mobile screen view to open up a link.

The scores section again I used a simple card, not using overly dense information, I give straightforward info plus 2 modals offering up more info and links. 

-The Media section

This footer is also consistent throughout the site, I give different pieces of easily digestable yet I feel, interesting bit of information that the user can click on and find out more. 
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

I feel there is plenty of room for feature implementation so I hope as I develop as a developer that I can adapt the site, adding more technical complexity but keeping it simple and user-friendly.

## Technologies Used 

I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 to build the main base of my site. 


In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    

At the beginning I did all of my testing on Google Chrome. However, I soon realised that Firefox, Safari and Internet Explore (among others) are still widely used, so I begain using them. Getting used to different dev-tools was a good exercise 


You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

The problems I encountered varied widely but I found them to be extremely satisfying to overcome. One issue was figuring out how to override Bootstrap classes. 
I found the bootstrap cards to be a finicky at times. 

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

I commited my updated often to Github, which is where my files were hosted

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Content
The text for section Y was copied from the Wikipedia article Z

I used the course content was substantially helped via the course content, despite it being a slower process and subject to mishaps, I often tried to type out my code using the course videos as help - jumbotron on my landing page. 

W3 Schools was an enormous help, a found it to be a really useful and vital tool. I used a modal inside of a card which I took the modal from W

Bootstrap 4 was used throughout my project. 

For the Navbar element, which is consitant throughout I used a combination of videos in testing and retesting, which were the following:

Media
The photos used in this site were obtained from ...

All the photos were taken on my Iphone 5 by me. I made some adjustments to the tone on a few of the photos like on the tips section whereby I modified the photo for a different effect.
